# COSA Development History

## 2025.06.29 - Completed Lupin Renaming in CoSA Module

### Summary (Part 2)
Completed the renaming from "Gib" to "Lupin" for search tools, fixing remaining import errors and ensuring FastAPI server starts successfully.

### Additional Work Performed
1. **Renamed search tool files**:
   - `search_gib.py` → `search_lupin.py`
   - `search_gib_v010.py` → `search_lupin_v010.py`
2. **Updated class names**:
   - Changed `GibSearch` to `LupinSearch` in both files
   - Updated all docstring references
3. **Fixed all imports and references**:
   - Updated `weather_agent.py` (both v000 and v010 versions)
   - Updated `todo_fifo_queue.py`
   - Updated documentation in `README.md`

### Result
- FastAPI server now starts successfully without import errors
- All search functionality properly renamed to Lupin branding
- Complete consistency between file names, class names, and imports

## 2025.06.29 - Fixed Import Errors from Lupin Renaming

### Summary
Fixed import errors in CoSA module that were preventing FastAPI server startup after yesterday's project renaming from "Genie-in-the-Box" to "Lupin".

### Work Performed
1. **Identified root cause**: The parent project's renaming (genie_client → lupin_client) wasn't propagated to the CoSA submodule
2. **Fixed critical import error**:
   - Updated `src/cosa/rest/routers/audio.py` line 19
   - Changed `from lib.clients import genie_client as gc` to `from lib.clients import lupin_client as gc`
3. **Updated commented references**:
   - Fixed 2 commented references in `src/cosa/rest/multimodal_munger.py` (lines 810, 813)
   - Changed from genie_client to lupin_client for consistency

### Technical Details
- These changes complete the renaming work started in the parent project on 2025.06.28
- FastAPI server can now start without ImportError
- No functional changes, only naming updates

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any other missed references during the renaming
- Continue with regular development tasks
