## 2025.06.29 - Fixed Import Errors from Lupin Renaming

### Summary
Fixed import errors in CoSA module that were preventing FastAPI server startup after yesterday's project renaming from "Genie-in-the-Box" to "Lupin".

### Work Performed
1. **Identified root cause**: The parent project's renaming (genie_client → lupin_client) wasn't propagated to the CoSA submodule
2. **Fixed critical import error**:
   - Updated `src/cosa/rest/routers/audio.py` line 19
   - Changed `from lib.clients import genie_client as gc` to `from lib.clients import lupin_client as gc`
3. **Updated commented references**:
   - Fixed 2 commented references in `src/cosa/rest/multimodal_munger.py` (lines 810, 813)
   - Changed from genie_client to lupin_client for consistency

### Technical Details
- These changes complete the renaming work started in the parent project on 2025.06.28
- FastAPI server can now start without ImportError
- No functional changes, only naming updates

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any other missed references during the renaming
- Continue with regular development tasks
