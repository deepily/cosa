## Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive, self-contained unit testing framework for CoSA that mirrors the existing smoke test structure but focuses on isolated component testing with mocked external dependencies. This will enable reliable CICD pipeline execution without external service dependencies.

### Strategic Goals
- **Self-Contained Testing**: Zero external service dependencies
- **CICD Ready**: Fast, reliable execution in GitHub Actions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 85%+ test coverage across all tiers
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear patterns and documentation

---

## 1. Unit Test Naming Convention & Architecture

### Naming Strategy
- **Function Convention**: `isolated_unit_test()` (parallels `quick_smoke_test()`)
- **File Convention**: `unit_test_*.py` (parallels `test_*.py` for smoke tests)
- **Module Discovery**: Auto-discovery via naming patterns, similar to smoke test orchestration

### Directory Structure
```

├── unit/                          # New unit test directory
│   ├── __init__.py

---

## 3. External Dependency Mocking Strategy

### Mock Management Architecture
- **Centralized MockManager**: Single source for all mocks across test suites
- **Contextual Mocking**: Scoped mocks that automatically clean up
- **Fixture-Based**: Reusable mock configurations for common scenarios

### Key Mocking Patterns

#### API Dependencies
```python
# OpenAI API mocking
mock_openai_embedding = MockManager.create_embedding_mock()
mock_completion_response = MockManager.create_completion_mock()

# External HTTP services
mock_kagi_search = MockManager.create_search_api_mock()
```

#### File System & Configuration
```python
# Configuration file mocking
mock_config_files = MockManager.create_config_mock({
    'agent_timeout': 30,
    'openai_api_key': 'test_key'
})

# File I/O mocking
mock_file_system = MockManager.create_filesystem_mock()
```

#### Database/Memory Systems
```python
# In-memory test databases
mock_embedding_cache = MockManager.create_memory_cache_mock()
mock_solution_snapshots = MockManager.create_snapshot_mock()
```
