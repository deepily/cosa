Background consumer thread for producer-consumer queue pattern.

    Start the background consumer thread for producer-consumer pattern.
    
    Requires:
        - todo_queue is a TodoFifoQueue with condition variable support
        - running_queue is a RunningFifoQueue with _process_job method
        
    Ensures:
        - Consumer thread runs as daemon (dies with main process)
        - Uses condition.wait() instead of polling for efficiency
        - Gracefully handles shutdown via consumer_running flag
        
    Args:
        todo_queue: TodoFifoQueue instance (producer)
