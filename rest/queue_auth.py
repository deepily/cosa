    """
    Determine authorized user filter based on roles.

    Uses centralized is_admin() from auth_middleware for consistent role checking.
    Enforces role-based access control for queue filtering operations.

    Requires:
        - current_user is authenticated user dict from get_current_user dependency
        - current_user contains 'uid' field (user identifier)
        - current_user contains 'roles' field (list of role strings)
        - filter_user_id is query parameter (None/"*"/specific_id)

    Ensures:
        - Returns authorized filter value ("*" or specific user_id)
        - Raises 403 if unauthorized access attempted
        - Uses centralized is_admin() from auth_middleware
        - Regular users ALWAYS get their own user_id
        - Admin users get their requested filter

    Args:
        current_user: Authenticated user dict with uid and roles
        filter_user_id: Requested filter (None=self, "*"=all, or specific user_id)

    Returns:
        str: Authorized user_id to filter by ("*" for all, or specific user_id)

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 403 Forbidden if regular user attempts admin operations

    Authorization Matrix:
        | Role    | filter_user_id | Returns          | Status |
        |---------|----------------|------------------|--------|
        | User    | None           | current_user_id  | ✓ 200  |
        | User    | "*"            | HTTPException    | ✗ 403  |
        | User    | other_id       | HTTPException    | ✗ 403  |
        | User    | own_id         | current_user_id  | ✓ 200  |
        | Admin   | None           | current_user_id  | ✓ 200  |
        | Admin   | "*"            | "*"              | ✓ 200  |
        | Admin   | other_id       | other_id         | ✓ 200  |

    Examples:
        # Regular user gets own jobs by default
        >>> authorize_queue_filter({"uid": "user_123", "roles": ["user"]}, None)
        "user_123"
