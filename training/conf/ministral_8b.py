Configuration for fine-tuning Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 model.

This configuration module defines the parameters needed by the PEFT Trainer to fine-tune
the Mistral AI's Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 model, which is a distilled version of the
larger Mistral model. The configuration is organized into four dictionaries that provide
model-specific parameters for the fine-tuning process:

1. fine_tune_config: Training parameters tailored for Ministral-8B:
   - sample_size: Full data (100%) by default (use --sample-size CLI arg to override)
   - batch_size: Very small batch size (2) due to the model's large memory requirements
   - gradient_accumulation_steps: High value (8) to compensate for small batch size
   - logging/eval_steps: Regular evaluation at 10% epoch intervals
   - device_map: Automatic GPU memory management for large model

2. lora_config: LoRA parameters customized for Ministral's architecture:
   - lora_alpha: Scaling factor for LoRA updates (16)
   - lora_dropout: 5% dropout for regularization
   - r: Higher rank (32) specifically chosen to address the low trainable parameter 
        percentage in this model (as noted in the comment)
   - target_modules: Specific attention and MLP layers for adaptation

3. tokenizer_config: Ministral-specific tokenization settings:
   - pad_token: Uses end-of-sequence token for padding
   - padding_side: Right padding during training, left padding for inference

4. model_config: Parameters specific to Ministral's usage:
   - max_seq_length: Moderate sequence length capability (683 tokens)
   - prompt_template: Custom instruction format with [INST]/[/INST] tags
   - last_tag_func: Properly closes sequences with </s> token when needed

The PEFT Trainer uses this configuration through load_model_config() to appropriately
initialize and fine-tune the Ministral model with these optimized settings. The configuration
accounts for Ministral's specific characteristics as a distilled model with memory efficiency
and architectural differences from other models in the collection.
