## Performance Metrics

### COSA Framework Performance
- **Test Execution Time**: 38.04 seconds
- **Module Loading Time**: <1.0s (estimated from fastest tests)
- **Memory Usage**: Normal (no excessive memory warnings observed)
- **Import Performance**: Successful framework import
- **External API Performance**: OpenAI embedding requests successful (multiple successful HTTP 200 responses)

### Category Performance Analysis
- **Fastest Category**: Core (0.00s total)
- **Slowest Category**: Memory (24.26s total) - Expected due to embedding operations
- **Most Resource Intensive**: Memory category with embedding operations and database interactions
- **Most Stable**: Core utilities and configuration management

## Known Issues Pattern Analysis

### Common Failure Patterns
No failure patterns identified - all tests achieved 100% pass rate.

### Framework Dependencies
- **External Dependencies**: All functioning correctly
  - OpenAI API connectivity: ✅ Working (successful embedding requests observed)
  - LanceDB: ✅ Working (warning messages are informational, not errors)
  - XML Schema validation: ✅ Working
- **Internal Dependencies**: All module imports successful
- **Environment Setup**: PYTHONPATH configuration working correctly

### Module Issues
No module-specific issues identified. All 4 categories achieved perfect pass rates:
- Core modules: Stable and fast
- REST modules: Queue operations functioning normally
- Memory modules: Embedding and database operations working as expected
- Training modules: Quantizer functioning correctly

### Performance Notes
- **LanceDB Warnings**: Multiple "nprobes is not set" warnings are informational only and do not affect functionality
- **Embedding Operations**: Successful API calls to OpenAI with normal response times
- **Database Operations**: All memory operations completed successfully within expected timeframes

## Baseline Established

This baseline establishes the COSA framework state as of 2025.09.23 17:30 EDT.
Any regressions introduced by upcoming changes can be measured against these metrics.

**Baseline Summary:**
- **Framework Status**: EXCELLENT (100% pass rate across all categories)
- **Performance Baseline**: 38.04s total execution time with expected performance distribution
- **Dependency Health**: All external and internal dependencies functioning correctly
- **Critical Systems**: All core, REST, memory, and training systems operational

**Next Steps**: Proceed with planned COSA framework changes. Use COSA post-change smoke test prompt after modifications to validate and remediate any introduced issues.
