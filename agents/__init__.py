"""
CoSA Agents Package

This package contains various agent implementations organized by version:

- v000/: Original agent implementations (legacy)
- v010/: Modernized agent implementations (v0.1.0)

For new development, prefer using the v010 implementations which provide:
- Better modularity and separation of concerns
- Improved LLM client abstractions
- More consistent error handling
- Support for multiple LLM providers
