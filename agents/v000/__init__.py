"""
CoSA Agents Legacy Package (v000)

This package contains the original agent implementations that were
developed as part of the initial CoSA framework. These agents are
maintained for backward compatibility but new development should
use the v010 implementations instead.

Legacy Components:
- AgentBase: Original base class for all agents
- Llm_v0: Original LLM interface for various models
- RunnableCode: Code generation and execution
- Various specialized agents (math, weather, todo, etc.)

Note: This package is considered legacy and will eventually be deprecated
once all functionality has been migrated to newer implementations.
